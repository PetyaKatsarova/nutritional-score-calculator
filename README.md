## Here i have 3 beginner's projects from udemy course:
#### nutritional-score-calculator
First thing to do to set up the project: In empty dir, on terminal type: go mod init github.com/PetyaKatsarova/nutritional-score-calculator

#### pr 2
To test the program u type in the terminal: go build main.go
after that type: ./main.exe
now the program runs with the already compiled code: faster
